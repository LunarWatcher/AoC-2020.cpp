# AoC-2020.cpp

My solutions to [Advent of Code](//adventofcode.com) (or as I like to call it, Edge Cases in Code) 2020. The build system is specifically configured to only work on Linux (and by extension, anything able to run GCC), because I can't be bothered to make it cross-platform.

I promise my code isn't usually this ugly.
